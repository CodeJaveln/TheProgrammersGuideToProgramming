The babylonian method is an effective way to calculate square roots
The number you want to take the square root of is called the radicant

Make a guess of it's square root and divide the radicant by the guess,
take the average of the guess and the division.
Divide the radicant by the average and take the average again.
Continuing this method will go towards the radicant's square root.
